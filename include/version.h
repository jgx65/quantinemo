*   quantiNemo:
*   quantiNemo is an individual-based, genetically explicit stochastic
*   simulation program. It was developed to investigate the effects of
*   selection, mutation, recombination, and drift on quantitative traits
*   with varying architectures in structured populations connected by
*   migration and located in a heterogeneous habitat.
*
*   quantiNemo is built on the evolutionary and population genetics
*   programming framework NEMO (Guillaume and Rougemont, 2006, Bioinformatics).
