# quantinemo
A swiss knife to simulate complex demographic and genetic scenarios

QuantiNemo 2 is a genetically explicit stochastic simulation program for population and quantitative genetics. 
It was developed to investigate the effects of selection, mutation, recombination and drift on quantitative traits and neutral markers in structured populations connected by migration and located in heterogeneous habitats. 
A specific feature is that it allows to switch between an individual-based full-featured mode and a population-based, faster mode.  
Several demographic, genetic and selective parameters can be fine tuned in QuantiNemo 2:  
population,  selection,  trait(s) architecture,  genetic  map  for  QTL  and/or  markers,  environment, demography, mating system are the main ones.

QuantiNemo 2 is a C++ program with a source code available under the GNU General Public License version 3. More information is available on https://www2.unil.ch/popgen/softwares/quantinemo/
