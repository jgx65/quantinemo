\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
This is where you tell people why they should bother reading your article.

\section{Literature Review}
This is the section that is invariably much longer than it should be, and
where everyone tries to impress peers about how easy it is to locate various
references in online databases.

\section{Conclusion}
Not much of a paper, but it's a start.
